# CLI Battleships (Work in Progress)

This is a **command-line implementation of Battleships** in Python.  
The game is playable in the terminal and currently supports:

- Random ship placement for both player and AI
- Player and AI turns (AI currently "easy" mode random targeting)
- Basic hit/miss logic and view updates
- Fog of war using separate ocean and radar views

This project is a work in progress and is designed to demonstrate Python programming, CLI interaction, and game logic implementation.
